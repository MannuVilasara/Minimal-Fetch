I am bored, so I'm going to write this.

# Introduction

Firstly, if you make any mistakes while committing or submitting a bug report, don't worry about it, mistakes are common and part of learning.
I want anyone here to feel comfortable committing or submitting bug reports to this repository.

Try to make your PR or Issue as clear as you can, but if you cannot I still want to hear what you have to say.

# How to make good commits to this repository

## Committing logos guide

regular logo images should be 24x24px and named `logo.png`,
and logo-big images should be 32x32px and named `logo-big.png`,
(PNG format necisary)
also, solid colours are preferable.

Next, make a plain text file called `dat` which is used for setting the logo accent. (eg, blue if arch, green if opensuse, etc)
Inside the file write `col: <Colour number>` eg `col: 4`

Some common colour codes are as follows:
1: red
2: green
3: yellow
4: blue
5: magenta
6: cyan
7: white
8: black

## Committing code guide

Pretty simple.
Just make a pull request. Preferably mention what your PR does.

If you don't know how to code, then I'm not putting a tutorial in here.

# How to report good reports to this repository

## Pre-report

Please submit reports in English. I would presume you know English if you are reading this, if you are using some sort of translation, use that to translate your bug report.

Check that you are running the latest version of mfetch, I will not fix issues in older versions.
If you want a bug fix in an old release, be happy to fork that release, I'm not updating it for you.

Please check for other people's bug reports, and see if any had the same issue as you.
If so, do something like upvoting their post, or adding a comment, rather than making a new issue.

Please do use common sense when making bug reports.

Attach screenshots or text outputs of what error/errors you got, also explain in as much detail as possible every aspect of the error.

Please use a relevant and informative title.
Eg use `Error with os-name not loading on Debian` instead of `broken name on mfetch`
(this is not massively important but can help issues easier to understand, and search for)

**Finally, remember your voice matters no matter how skilled or smart you are :)**
